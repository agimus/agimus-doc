/// \mainpage Agimus: a framework for manipulation motion planning and control.
///
/// \section agimus_doc_sec_intro Introduction
///
/// \c Agimus is a framework aimed at integrating motion planning and
/// motion control of manipulation tasks for a wide variety of robots.
/// The computation pipeline is composed of several steps
///
/// \li A motion is planned based on a model of the robot, environment
/// and objects to grasp, the result is a sequence of manipulation
/// motions. Along each segment of the motion, a set of constraints is
/// active (object grasped by a gripper, object still in a stable
/// pose). This step is performed by the software platform HPP
/// (Humanoid Path Planner), running in an executable that implements
/// a CORBA server. To trigger path planning and get solution paths, a
/// <a href="@HPP_MANIPULATION_CORBA_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">
/// CORBA client</a> is run in a ROS node.
///
/// \li For each segment of the motion, a controller is created in the
/// Stack of Tasks framework. This step is produced by package
/// <a href="@AGIMUS_SOT_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html"> \c agimus-sot </a>.
/// Reference motions for each task is extracted from the planned trajectory
/// by <a href="@AGIMUS_HPP_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">agimus-hpp</a>.
///
/// \li A finite state machine switch from one controller to the next
///  one.  This finite state machine is implemented in package
///  <a href="@AGIMUS_PREFIX@/share/doc/agimus/doxygen-html/index.html"> \c agimus </a>.
