/// \mainpage Agimus: a framework for manipulation motion planning and control.
///
/// \section agimus_doc_sec_intro Introduction
///
/// \c Agimus is a framework aimed at integrating motion planning and
/// motion control of manipulation tasks for a wide variety of robots.
/// The computation pipeline is composed of several steps
///
/// \li A motion is planned based on a model of the robot, environment
/// and objects to grasp, the result is a sequence of manipulation
/// motions. Along each segment of the motion, a set of constraints is
/// active (object grasped by a gripper, object still in a stable
/// pose). This step is performed by the software platform HPP
/// (Humanoid Path Planner), running in an executable that implements
/// a CORBA server. To trigger path planning and get solution paths, a
/// <a href="@HPP_MANIPULATION_CORBA_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">
/// CORBA client</a> is run in a ROS node.
///
/// \li For each segment of the motion, a controller is created in the
/// Stack of Tasks framework. This step is produced by package
/// <a href="@AGIMUS_SOT_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html"> \c agimus-sot </a>.
/// Reference motions for each task is extracted from the planned trajectory
/// by <a href="@AGIMUS_HPP_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">agimus-hpp</a>.
///
/// \li A finite state machine switch from one controller to the next
///  one.  This finite state machine is implemented in package
///  <a href="@AGIMUS_PREFIX@/share/doc/agimus/doxygen-html/index.html"> \c agimus </a>.
///
/// \section agimus_doc_sec_architecture ROS runtime architecture
///
/// Execution on a robot is performed using ROS middleware. The
/// software architecture depends on whether the demo is run on a
/// robot, or in simulation.
///
/// \subsection agimus_doc_subsec_geomtric_simu Geometric Simulation
///
/// In this mode, the control input computed by the Stack of Tasks software is
/// integrated to update the configuration of the robot. The two figures below
/// display the ROS node architecture.
///
/// The nodes more specific to agimus architecture are the following
///
/// Node name | package | type | description
/// --------- | ------- | ---- | -----------
/// /agimus/hpp/hpp_node  | <a href="@AGIMUS_HPP_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">agimus-hpp</a> | <a href=@AGIMUS_HPP_PKGDATAROOTDIR@/agimus-hpp/scripts/hpp_node.py>hpp_node.py</a> | Client to HPP manipulation planner. Note that \c hppcorbaserver executable must be running and accessible via CORBA channel. This node reads from \c hppcorbaserver. Manipulation planning requests should be launched by the user.
/// /agimus/hpp/hpp_estimation | <a href="@AGIMUS_HPP_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">agimus-hpp</a> | estimation.py | Estimates the geometric state of the system based on known constraints: such object should be on such table... (see class agimus-hpp.estimation.Estimation).
/// /agimus/sot/start_supervisor | <a href="@AGIMUS_SOT_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">agimus-sot</a> | <a href=@AGIMUS_SOT_PKGDATAROOTDIR@/agimus-sot/scripts/start_supervisor.py>start_supervisor.py</a> | Runs a script in the remote python interpreter of the Stack Of Tasks (service \c RunCommand). The name of the script is given as a parameter (see <a href=@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/agimus_demos/talos/manipulate_boxes/supervisor.py>default script</a>).
/// /agimus/path_execution_fsm | <a href="@AGIMUS_PREFIX@/share/doc/agimus/doxygen-html/index.html"> agimus </a> | path_execution_fsm.py | Creates a finite-state machine implemented using smach (see ROS wiki for displaying the fsm).
/// /agimus/path_execution_supervision | <a href="@AGIMUS_PREFIX@/share/doc/agimus/doxygen-html/index.html"> agimus </a> | rqt_path_execution | GUI that enables the user to control the above finite-state machine in order to follow the planned trajectory as desired (step by step, one shot,...)
